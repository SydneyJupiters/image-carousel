Steps to See live Code:

1.) Open terminal or code editor (I used Vs code)
1.) Cd into Test/
3.) Using the live server extension click on the button on the bottom right of the screen titles "Go Live"
4.) The project should open live on the broswer.

Tip: 
- There are some small buttons on either side of the images to manually skip carousel slides.
- You can also go into the main.js file on line 12-13 and chnage the duration of the slide timer.
